The traditional economy is an economic system based on currencies issued by governments and financial institutions. Its main characteristics are centralization, transparency and stability. Virtual currency is a currency based on digital technology. Its main features are decentralization, anonymity and fast transactions.
The main advantages of a traditional economy are its stability and trust, as governments and financial institutions manage and oversee the money supply. However, this centralization also brings some problems, such as policy abuse, credit crisis and inflation.
Virtual currency aims to solve these problems in the traditional economy through decentralized design. For example, Bitcoin creator Alan Strasberg mentioned in his paper that the goal of Bitcoin is to "eliminate government control of the currency supply" to achieve a more stable, transparent, and fair monetary system .
